Some projects I am currently working on:

**Consequences of complex communication by the European Commission**
The European Union is not only the supranational institution with the most influence on national politics but also one of the most publicly criticized. Faced with this increasing pressure, the EU needs to legitimize its’ actions to the general public. However, one crucial barrier to these attempts is the inherent difficulty of communicating the often highly technical decisions of the European Commission. As a result, communication attempts of the European Commission are exceedingly complex. What are the effects of this complex messaging on attitudes towards decisions of the European Commission? In a preregistered survey experiment (N=1200) I expose respondents to messages by the European Commission in both the original version and in a less complex, but otherwise equivalent version. The results show that infringement procedures against Germany instigated by the European Commission are more likely to be accepted by german citizens when they are communicated in easy to understand language. Investigating the mechanisms behind that effect, I find that easier messaging is particularly effective for supporters of the European Union and for those interested in politics. 

**Information and Motivation: How do attitudes towards International Organizations deveop?**

To explain the recent public contestation of International Organizations (IOs), researchers have often looked for micro-level explanations. Research has demonstrated that various factors influence attitudes towards IOs, ranging from characteristics of IOs themselves and the consequences of IO activity to contestation by political elites. However, citizens have very little ability or motivation to engage with information about these abstract issues. Instead, they might rely more on simple heuristics and rely on feelings of generalized trust or perceived familiarity of an institution. I argue that the effects of the proposed explanatory factors are conditional on individual psychological characteristics. I conducted a factorial survey experiment using a large sample of the German population (N=958), exposing participants to multiple fictitious IOs, their basic features, and domestic political elites’ reactions. Contrary to previous work on the effect of a high international authority on individual attitudes, I find that German citizens do respond to information about international authority even in the presence of strong party cues. Moreover, these effects are more substantial for respondents motivated to engage in reflective reasoning. The results suggest that citizens can hold differentiated beliefs about IOs and do not always fall back on heuristic shortcuts.

**Attitudes towards the European Commission: Understanding does not imply supporting**



**Is there support for a internationally binding Global Compact for Migration?**
