**Consequences of complex communication by the European Commission**
[Working Paper](/assets/WorkingPaperEC.pdf)
<details>
<summary>More</summary>

The European Union is the supranational institution with the most influence on national politics and one of the most publicly criticized. Faced with this increasing pressure, the EU needs to legitimize its’ actions to the general public. However, one crucial barrier to these attempts is the inherent difficulty of communicating the often highly technical decisions of the European Commission. As a result, communication attempts of the European Commission are exceedingly complex. What are the effects of this complex messaging on attitudes towards decisions of the European Commission? In a preregistered survey experiment (N=1200), I expose respondents to messages by the European Commission in both the original version and in a less complex but otherwise equivalent version. The results show that infringement procedures against Germany instigated by the European Commission are more likely to be accepted by german citizens when they are communicated in easy-to-understand language. Investigating the mechanisms behind that effect, I find that easier messaging is particularly effective for supporters of the European Union and for those interested in politics.

**Information and Motivation: How do attitudes towards International Organizations develop?**
<details>
<summary>More</summary>
To explain the recent public contestation of International Organizations (IOs), researchers have often looked for micro-level explanations. Research has demonstrated that various factors influence attitudes towards IOs, ranging from characteristics of IOs themselves and the consequences of IO activity to contestation by political elites. However, citizens have very little ability or motivation to engage with information about these abstract issues. Instead, they might rely more on simple heuristics and rely on feelings of generalized trust or perceived familiarity of an institution. I argue that the effects of the proposed explanatory factors are conditional on individual psychological characteristics. I conducted a factorial survey experiment using a large sample of the German population (N=958), exposing participants to multiple fictitious IOs, their basic features, and domestic political elites’ reactions. Contrary to previous work on the effect of high international authority on individual attitudes, I find that German citizens do respond to information about international authority even in the presence of strong party cues. Moreover, these effects are more substantial for respondents motivated to engage in reflective reasoning. The results suggest that citizens can hold differentiated beliefs about IOs and do not always fall back on heuristic shortcuts.

**Salience Matters: Crisis affectedness, elite cues and IO public legitimacy (with Bernd Schlipphak & Osman Sabri Kiratli)**

What effects do international crises have on the public legitimacy of International Organizations (IOs)? It might be the case that such crises make issue-relevant IOs more relevant. As a result, the public legitimacy of those IOs becomes more dependent on citizens’ crisis-induced worries, leading to a more positive view of those IOs. Additionally, as the higher salience also leads to higher levels of elite communication regarding IOs, elite blaming of the IOs during crises results in direct negative effects on public legitimacy beliefs on IOs. Finally, both the valence and content of the elite discourse additionally moderate the positive effects of crisis-induced worries. Implementing survey experiments on public legitimacy beliefs on the WHO during the COVID-19 crisis with about 4400 respondents in Austria, Germany and Turkey, we find preliminary evidence for these expectations

**Trust in the UN: The case of the Global Compact for Migration**
<details>
<summary>More</summary>
The Global Compact for Migration has been one of the most hotly debated UN agreements in recent years. Despite being a non-binding agreement, it generated strong opposition both from some governments (such as the United States and Hungary) and from domestic actors (right-wing parties in European democracies). A key argument from opponents of the GCM was the perceived reduction of national sovereignty caused by the agreement. Using the timing of interviews as a quasi-randomization strategy, I demonstrate that the discussions around the agreement had a negative effect on trust towards the UN in Germany. This effect is not present among respondents opposed to migration, indicating that the failure to find an agreement on international rules for safe migration led to disappointment in the UN. In a similar vein, in a representative survey experiment in Germany, I show that a binding GCM would have led to *increased* support. Together, my results indicate that increasing international authority can lead to higher trust in IOs.
