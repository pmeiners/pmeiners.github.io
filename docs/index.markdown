I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the department of sociology and political science at the NTNU in Trondheim, Norway. 
In 2023, I received my PhD from the University of MÃ¼nster studying the conditions under which increasing competencies affect the social legitimacy of International Organizations. 
              
My research focuses on attitudes towards institutionalized forms of international cooperation.
I mainly use experimental methods to investigate the psychological mechanisms behind political behavior.
