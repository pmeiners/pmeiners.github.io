I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the department of sociology and political science at the NTNU in Trondheim, Norway. 
In 2023, I received my PhD from the University of MÃ¼nster studying how citizens change their minds on International Organizations such as the EU and the UN.
              
My current research focuses on self-legitimation and political communication in relation to the EU and international cooperation in general.
I mainly use experimental methods to investigate the psychological mechanisms behind political behavior.
