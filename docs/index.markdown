I’m a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the University of Münster. I received my MA in Comparative Politics from the University of Freiburg and Sciences Po Aix in 2018. 

My research focuses on attitudes towards institutionalized forms of international cooperation. I mainly use experimental methods to investigate the psychological mechanisms behind political behavior.
